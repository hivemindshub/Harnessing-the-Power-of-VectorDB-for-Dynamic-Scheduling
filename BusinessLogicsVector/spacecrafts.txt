spacecraft traveling at 1/4 the speed of light, 

Key Assumptions:
Speed of Light: 299,792 km/s.
Travel Speed: 1/4 of the speed of light = 299,792 km/s * 0.25 = 74,948 km/s.


Distances and Travel Times

Earth to Moon:
Distance = 384,400 km
Time = Distance / Speed = 384,400 km / 74,948 km/s ≈ 5.13 seconds

Earth to Mars:
Distance = 225,000,000 km
Time = Distance / Speed = 225,000,000 km / 74,948 km/s ≈ 3,003.7 seconds or 50.06 minutes

Moon to Mars:
Distance = 225,000,000 km + 384,400 km ≈ 225,384,400 km
Time = Distance / Speed = 225,384,400 km / 74,948 km/s ≈ 3,006.2 seconds or 50.1 minutes


Distance Estimations:
Earth to Titan: ~1.2 billion km
Earth to Saturn: ~1.4 billion km
Titan to Saturn: ~1.2 million km (since Titan orbits Saturn)
