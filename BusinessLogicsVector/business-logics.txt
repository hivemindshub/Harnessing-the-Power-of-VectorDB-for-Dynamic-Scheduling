Business Logic and Rules
Flight Duration Calculation

Earth to Moon: Approximately 0.4 hours (24 minutes).
Earth to Mars: Approximately 0.75 hours (45 minutes).
Moon to Mars: Approximately 0.65 hours (39 minutes).
Earth to Titan: Approximately 4.44 hours.
Earth to Saturn: Approximately 5.19 hours.
Titan to Saturn: Approximately 4.44 hours.
Arrival Time Calculation

ALocDate: Determine by adding BlockT (flight duration) to the DLocDate and DLocT (departure date and time). Handle date transitions and time zones appropriately.
Date and Time Management

Adjust ALocDate to reflect the accurate arrival time considering possible changes in dates due to flight duration.
Ensure that date and time transitions are handled accurately, accounting for multiple days if necessary.
Time Zone Differences

DGMTDiff and AGMTDiff: The difference in time zones between departure and arrival locations should be applied when calculating arrival times.
Block Time

Reflects the time spent traveling between base stations. Ensure this matches the calculated flight durations based on speed and distance.
Credit Time

Equal to BlockT since there are no additional layovers or delays in this simplified model.
LocDays

Typically set to 1 day for simplicity, as flights are assumed to be completed within a single day.
Flight Scheduling Constraints

Frequency: Ensure that flights between each pair of base stations occur frequently enough to meet operational needs.
Availability: Ensure base stations have sufficient capacity to handle the scheduled flights and incoming traffic.
Conflicts: Avoid scheduling conflicts by ensuring that no two flights are scheduled to arrive or depart from the same base station at the same time.
Base Station Operations

Maintenance Windows: Include considerations for base station maintenance which might affect flight scheduling.
Operational Hours: Ensure flight schedules align with the operational hours of base stations.
